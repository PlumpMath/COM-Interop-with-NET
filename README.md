COM-Interop-with-NET
====================
Sample code demonstrate COM Interoperability with .NET using classic (IConnectionPoint) and delegate (.net delegates) models.
For example, in this project showed how to interact with Microsoft Word for monitoring all opened documents.

Summary, using classical model is more efficient for cases when you need to get much more events from COM. In other cases using .net delegates is preferable because code is much easy for understanding and maintenance.
